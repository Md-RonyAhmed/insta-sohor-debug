                            JavaScript is not a compiled language, it is an interpreted language. Before running a
                            program, such as C++ or Java, it must be compiled. The original code is run via a software
                            known as a compiler, which converts it into bytecode that the machine can understand and
                            execute. JavaScript, on the other hand, does not require compilation. Instead, a browser
                            interpreter reads the JavaScript code, understands each line, and executes it. Modern
                            browsers utilize a process known as Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, which converts
                            JavaScript to executable bytecode just before it is going to be executed.
                            And it has runtime model that called event loop that help javascript program to run the code
                            asynchronously. It has a one and only thread in javascript for executing the whole process
                            but event loop handle the multitasking easily. All javascript program run on the executing
                            context.

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            We know that JavaScript is a single-threaded synchronous programming language.
                            single-threaded means javascript run or executed the code in a top to bottom approach not a
                            parallel way to execute code. It has only one threaded that runs javascript code line by
                            line at a time that is also called synchronous programming. It also a interpreted language
                            it compiled the code line to line.
                            Here, event loop comes for handling the multitasking at a time. Event loop is a javascript
                            runtime model that executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing the
                            sub-tasks that remaining on the queue. It has a messaged queue that work like FIFO(First In
                            First Out). It has a web api and a call stack that work like LIFO(Last In Last Out). When we
                            run a javascript file at first it run the first line of code then if any code exciting the
                            setTimeOut or any time interval that wait in the web api and other code of the line that
                            goes to the call stack and when the time interval was finished then setTimeOut method go
                            into the messaged queue and then it will go through the call stack by the help of event
                            loop.
                            We see the visual representation of event loop working principle in fig-1.
                            So, event loop help javascript to run the code in asynchronously for that it doesn't wait
                            for other code that would be executed next.

                        What's the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage?

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that data in localStorage does not
                            expire, but data in sessionStorage is removed when the page session expires. A page session
                            lasts as long as the tab or browser is active and survives page reloads and restorations but
                            localStorage survives and save into the browser localStorage for a long time.
                            Obviously, if the data we're saving has to be available on a continuous basis, localStorage
                            is preferable to sessionStorage - but keep us in mind that both may be wiped by the user, so
                            shouldn't rely on the data's continued presence in any case.

                            LocalStorage and sessionStorage are ideal for storing non-sensitive data between pages in
                            client scripts (for example: preferences, scores in games). Because the data saved in
                            localStorage and sessionStorage may be readily read or altered from inside the
                            client/browser, they should not be used to store sensitive or security-related data within
                            apps.
